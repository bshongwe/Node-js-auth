# Node.js Authentification
First developed by Imtiyaz Nandasaniya and Dimas Rachmadika
This is an example that builds a secure login system using JWT
Still going to develop this project further


## Why Authentification?
To keep user data safe, ensuring that only authorised users can access it. Hence, let's call it a digital lock that grants entry only to those with the right key (credentials)


## Requirements
1. RESTFUL API fundamentals
2. MongoDB or other similar database setup
3. JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
4. bcrypt.js


## Registering Users
File: <code>bcrypt.js</code>
